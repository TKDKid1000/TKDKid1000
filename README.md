Wyvern - the open source Discord clone - is public! Visit [WyvernChat/Wyvern](https://github.com/WyvernChat/Wyvern) for the source of the main app.<br />
As an open source piece of Wyvern, I also recently started [MediaWare](https://github.com/WyvernChat/MediaWare), which is an open source image proxy/upload server. It handles resizing, cropping, and storage.

Currently working hard on replicating a functional human as a multi-purpose chatbot using various technologies. You can find the project over on [gpt-me](https://github.com/TKDKid1000/gpt-me) to learn more.

I have created my own package manager for python that feels a lot like npm, [pypm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkdkid1000/pypm)!

I am also creating my own Javascript framework, it's called [kitten.js](https://github.com/TKDKid1000/kitten.js). It's a fun and fast framework, just like a kitten.
