### Hi there! I'm TKDKid1000!

I’m a minecraft developer for CyberhubMC. 
I code in mostly java, and have contributed to large projects like Essentialsx.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I’m currently working on a few projects for [CyberhubMC](http://cyberhub.net:10000).

I’m currently learning JavaScript so I can develop my website. 

Ask me about some of my current projects! Like MCGO or splat craft.
