### Hi there! I'm TKDKid1000!

Iâ€™m a web developer and Minecraft challenge creator. 
Mostly, I code in typescript (node.js), but I also use java, swift, and python.

Check out my website at [https://tkdkid1000.net](https://tkdkid1000.net)!

I have created my own package manager for python that feels a lot like npm, [pypm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkdkid1000/pypm)!

Ask me about some of my current projects! I am attempting to recreate Discord... It's called [Wyvern](https://github.com/WyvernChat), [go check it out](https://github.com/WyvernChat/Wyvern). I need help with css and images so if you wanna help please do so. 

I am also creating my own Javascript framework, it's called [kitten.js](https://github.com/TKDKid1000/kitten.js). It's a fun and fast framework, just like a kitten.

Want to contact me? Email [me@tkdkid1000.net](mailto:me@tkdkid1000.net), or add TKDKid1000#0406 on discord.
